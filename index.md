I am a Mechanical Engineering major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028.

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs 

* Lab 9
    Lab 9 was a really fun lab for me because it helped me understand how multiple files work together inside a  single project. Prior to this lab I had not fully understood how header files and implementation files worked or why they were important. After completing this lab I felt so much better working with bigger codebases and organizing my programs in a way that made them easier to read and understand so they can be easily debugged and improved.

* Lab 6
    Lab 6 is easily one of my favorite labs because it showed me how programming lays the groundwork for larger and more creative projects, such as video games. I liked playing around with string manipulation and watching how the program responded differently based on the user's input. It made me realize that coding can be both technical and even artsy at the same time, which made the entire lab really fun and memorable.

* Lab 10
    Lab 10 really stood out to me to be one of my favorites because it introduced randomness and animation, two ideas I can probably use in future persona projects. Learning how to generate random outcomes and visually displaying results made coding feel more  dynamic and creative. This lab also boosted my confidence in experimenting with interactive or visual elements, helping me see how far my coding skills can be taken in fun and practical ways.
